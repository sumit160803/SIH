Leaf Recognition System
Overview
This project, "leaf_recognition_system," was developed by myself and three friends as part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). The aim was to create an image processing AI model capable of recognizing different medical leaves.

Project Details
Model Architecture: The model was built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Dataset: We utilized a publicly available leaf dataset for training purposes.
Objective: Our primary goal was to develop a tool that could differentiate various medicinal leaves, thereby addressing the lack of knowledge about medical plants.
Functionality: Users can scan a leaf using the system and obtain information about it.
Learning Experience
This project provided valuable insights into the fields of AI and data processing. We gained hands-on experience with Python libraries for rendering results.
